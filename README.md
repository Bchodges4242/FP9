Instructions on how to run with your own API KEY:
1. Create a file called .env in the same folder as the main.py file.
2. Create a variable OPENAI_API_KEY and set it equal to your API KEY. (No quotes or anything else needed)

If you don't have .dotenv installed you need to install the pip dependencies. 
Happy A.Ing
